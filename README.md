# REACT AWESOME CLOCK

react-awesome-clock is a react component which can be used in any one of the following ways:
- A Normal Clock 
- Days Count from a certain date (StartDate as mentioned in docs).

Why react-awesome-clock?

1. **Single Component for every type of clock** - It provides you a generic clock component, which allows you to design it dynamically as you want. You can aply whatever style you want. You can also use it as a timer by just providing the starting date using momentJS.
